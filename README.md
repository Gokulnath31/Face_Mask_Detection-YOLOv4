# Face_Mask_Detection-YOLOv4


In the present scenario due to Covid-19, there is no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand for transportation means, densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers and other enterprises to ensure safety. The model detects different types of face and head coverings and identifies whether a person is wearing a face mask or not.The model was trained on the top of Darknet implementation on 6000 images. 
The mean average precision of the model is 96.06%.The avg loss of the model is 3.8.
